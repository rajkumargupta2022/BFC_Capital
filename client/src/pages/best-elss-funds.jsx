          <h2>Best ELSS Funds</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
          <p>Let’s just start by understanding the basics of ELSS funds. In simple terms, ELSS funds are Mutual Funds that offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. As mandated by regulatory bodies, they invest a majority of their accumulated corpus in equity or equity-related instruments. What makes this asset class desirable is its tendency to deliver healthy returns. However, given the volatility equity markets are subjected to, certain dos and don’ts have to be kept in mind before infusing capital in this asset class. Let’s find those out.</p>

          <p>Given the number of economic influences and vulnerabilities the equity market is susceptible to, it is advisable that all fundamentals fuelling an ELSS scheme’s growth be observed closely and scrutinised for irregularities or flaws in compounding strategy before investing.</p>
          <p>Investors also need to assure that the underlying funds of the ELSS scheme in their portfolio are monitored and switched if required to avoid any kickbacks from the global market. Also, the tax benefits offered under the scheme and the quantum of investment should be sufficient to accommodate the tax liability the investor is to attract.</p>
          <p>In simple terms, the best ELSS Funds are those that match investment objectives and do not compromise on returns on the pretext of offering tax benefits.</p>

          <h2>Why should you avoid the Best ELSS Funds ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> On 1 February 2020, the NIFTY Index, which represents the weighted average of the 50 largest Indian companies on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) registered a drop of approximately 373 points, simultaneous to the presentation of the Union Budget and the weight of the global breakdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. This was accompanied by a 987 point fall in the Sensex. The Covid-driven economic stress pulled down the NIFTY another 432 points on 28 February 2020, again accompanied by a 1448-point Sensex drop. This intermittent downward trend continued to trouble global markets, including India, until the last week of March, wherein the Sensex lost 3,934.72 points and NIFTY plunged 1,135 points, as coronavirus-led lockdowns across the world triggered fears of a recession.</p>
          <p>However, driven by humanity’s survival instincts, the world started recovering soon after, whilst learning new ways to conduct business and restore the supply chain. This resurgence also rejuvenated consumer sentiment and was the catalyst for a stellar recovery in the market.</p>
          <p>Riding on this recovery, several Mutual Fund schemes raced to recovery, ELSS Funds included. The AMCs and entities promoting these schemes, however, took this as an advertising opportunity and improvised the “as of” yields to exhibit beyond-normal gains.</p>
          <p>Long story short, displaying unexpected gains is a posturing technique, a marketing gimmick deployed by AMCs to promote their schemes. Unfortunately, many have fallen prey to this trap so far and have ended up investing in such schemes, only to regret the decision at a later stage.</p>
          <p>Investors ought to understand that ELSS schemes have a lock in period of 3 years, which means if funds are parked in a not-so-good scheme, the investor won't be able to do anything about it for those 3 years - this makes choosing the right scheme even more critical in case of the ELSS Category. Simply put, when it comes to investing, seeking professional help is the only step in the right direction</p>
