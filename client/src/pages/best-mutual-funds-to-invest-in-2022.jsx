          <h2>Best Mutual Funds: Reality or Myth ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>So, how does one identify the Best Mutual Funds for 2022? Does such a thing even exist ?</p>
          <p>To be honest, best Mutual Funds could be a thing if the investor has access to the right advice, and the will to act on it, and a myth, if not.</p>
          <p>See, Mutual Fund schemes cannot be identified and invested in based on the one-size-fits-all approach, which, unfortunately, most Asset Management Companies (AMC) and bot advisories are pushing consumers towards.</p>
          <p>Every individual has varying monetary liabilities, investment objectives and horizons that need to be factored in along with certain other aspects before opting for a Mutual Fund scheme. For instance, a 25-year-old looking to purchase a car can entertain the thought of chasing returns since he has time and age on his side. Consequently, he can invest in relatively ambitious schemes to achieve the targeted corpus much before the intended deadline. A homemaker, on the other hand, who just wants to keep safe the money she has saved over time, may not want to be that adventurous, and therefore would opt for a scheme that offers consistent returns whilst keeping her invested corpus intact.</p>
          <p>Simply put, the best Mutual Funds schemes are in alignment with the investor’s investment objective, and therefore have to be opted for based on the horses for courses approach, so to speak.</p>

          <h2>How to Select the Best Mutual Funds ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Before learning how to select the best Mutual Funds, investors need to understand the role SEBI-registered investment advisors play. Let’s just start by looking at what individual investors normally accomplish on their own. Historically speaking, the abilities of individual investors are mostly average, with most of them underperforming in the market more often than not. Why? Because they tend to rely on half-cooked research, and previous yields, that can be misleading to say the least.</p>
          <p>SEBI-registered investment advisors would not have existed if shortlisting investment options was that easy. Investors need to understand that there is a reason why people rely on professionals when it comes to availing financial advice, mutual funds included.</p>
          <p>First of all, these are professionals trained to scrutinise and study Mutual Fund schemes in great detail. The scope of this study goes beyond comparing the returns fetched previously. Also, they have access to insightful and intelligent resources that lay out the good and bad of Mutual Fund schemes in a very objective manner, and help them identify schemes that are in line with the investor’s agenda.</p>
          <p>Now that we have established the relevance of seeking professional advice, let’s move on to understand, How to Select the Best Mutual Funds ?</p>
          <p>The ideal strategy for an investor herein is to prioritise. One must have clarity about his purpose for investing in mutual funds, the amount he can set aside for this purpose, and the tenure for which he can stay invested, among other things. These variables must be conveyed to the professional helping the investor shortlist a mutual fund scheme, so that a scheme can be shortlisted accordingly.</p>

          <h2>Benefits of Investing in Best Mutual Funds for 2022</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Ultimately, everyone wants to invest in an asset class that offers manifold returns, which is why <b className="highlighted-text">Mutual Funds</b> are investors' favourites. There are just too many benefits of investing in the <b className="highlighted-text">Best Mutual Funds</b>. Read on to find out:</p>
          <p><b>Professional Money Management</b></p>
          <p>Mutual Funds are managed by qualified fund managers, each backed by a team of analysts to research the market and predict its ups and downs, saving the investors the trouble of managing their finances.</p>
          <p><b>Pocket-friendly Investing</b></p>
          <p>Mutual fund investments are easy on the pocket, and investors can accumulate considerable wealth by investing in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Consequently, they don't have to make unnecessary sacrifices to accommodate the investment. And the best part is that they can figure out the amount they need to invest for a specific objective using a <b className="highlighted-text">SIP Calculator.</b></p>
          <p><b>Automatic Diversification</b></p>
          <p>Mutual funds invest their accumulated wealth in various assets, allowing investors to choose from multiple investment options. The investors also enjoy the exposure that comes with a diverse portfolio, as it reduces the risk factor and aims at consistent returns.</p>
          <p><b>Healthy Returns</b></p>
          <p>Mutual funds work on the principles of compounding and thus have the potential to show exponentional growth over the long term. Simply put, the more time the invested money spends in the market, the more it is likely to grow.</p>
          <p><b>Ready Liquidity</b></p>
          <p>Liquidity is the ease with which an individual can convert an investment into cash. Mutual funds have a quick process, and an investor can easily redeem units from his mutual fund scheme online or offline, and the same gets transferred to their bank account within a few days.</p>
          <p><b>Tax Efficiency</b></p>
          <p>Mutual funds offer tax benefits under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. Along with this, investors are eligible for a yearly tax exemption of up to 1 lakh on LTCG(Long term Capital Gains) on equity mutual funds. If the gains exceed the limit, investors are liable to pay LTCG tax @10% only.</p>

          <h2>What are the risks associated with investing in a mutual fund?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p><b className="highlighted-text">Mutual Funds</b> are invested in various asset classes, due to which they are bound to market fluctuation. These market fluctuations can lead to potential losses; therefore, analyzing the risk associated with investing in mutual funds is necessary. Listed below are the risks that accompany mutual funds.</p>
          <p><b>Market Risk</b></p>
          <p>Market risk arises due to the underperformance of the market resulting in losses. However, several reasons are responsible for the poor performance, like a pandemic, global slowdown, inflation, and so on, making it difficult for investors to invest in the most appropriate mutual fund.</p>
          <p><b>Concentration Risk</b></p>
          <p>Concentration basically means focusing on one thing, and so does concentration risk. When the mutual fund schemes invest the entire accumulated corpus in one asset class, the chances of risk are higher. The best way to avoid such threats is by diversifying the portfolio. The more spread out the portfolio, the lesser at risk it shall be.</p>
          <p><b>Interest Rate Risk</b></p>
          <p>The fluctuation in a debt fund's NAV due to changes in interest rates is known as Interest Rate Risk. Whenever the interest rate rises, the debt fund's NAV falls, making them inversely related to each other and vice versa.</p>
          <p><b>Liquidity Risk</b></p>
          <p>Liquidity risk refers to the inability to redeem units from a mutual fund scheme. This usually happens when a seller is unable to find a buyer for the security or when the investment is made in ELSS schemes that have a mandatory three-year lock-in period.</p>
          <p><b>Credit Risk</b></p>
          <p>When the issuer of a bond purchased by a mutual fund is unable to pay the promised interest, it is referred to as Credit Risk. Investors can evaluate credit risk by analyzing the credit ratings given by multiple credit rating companies.</p>

          <h2>Why should you avoid the Best Mutual Funds ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Many investors make the mistake of investing in Mutual Fund schemes based on previous returns. Investors should refrain from investing in table-topper funds, simply because the first-hand research required to identify suitable schemes goes beyond comparing previous returns.</p>
          <p>Case in point, if you look at the previous one-year data, specifically near the end of March 2022, it shall reveal certain eye-popping figures. This is owing to the fact that the Indian market crashed heavily exactly in the corresponding period of last year i.e. March 2020. The recovery from that point onwards has been phenomenal.</p>
          <p>Riding on this recovery, several Mutual Fund schemes rode to recovery, and are now showing beyond normal returns in the past one year.</p>
          <p>It is unfair and misleading to claim that the performance of these funds is owing to good stock picking. On the contrary, it is more like a rising tide lifted all the boats in its vicinity.</p>
          <p>This posturing, so to speak, has misled many investors, old and new, to infuse capital in schemes that otherwise would have failed to invoke investor sentiment. This is a mistake all should avoid. Mutual Funds should only be shortlisted after thorough research, that too by someone who knows what he/she is doing, which brings us to our next point, How to Select the Best Mutual Funds ?</p>
