          <h2>Best SIP Plans : Reality or Myth ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>The biggest mistake newbie investors make is investing in an SIP based on previous yields. Investors need to understand an SIP’s previous performance does not ensure consistent upward trajectory moving forward, in terms of the returns fetched.</p>
          <p>See, every investor has a different set of liabilities and obligations, making his or her investment agenda unique.</p>
          <p>Consequently, an SIP that suits a youngster looking to build a corpus expeditiously by adopting an ambitious compounding strategy, may not be fit a salaried individual aiming to accumulate wealth for his post retirement needs. The Best SIP Plans are those that are in line with investor priorities.</p>
          <p>Simply put, they cannot be identified based on generic parameters. However, most Asset Management Companies (AMC) and bot advisories are pushing consumers to opt for one-size-fits-all plans, which, unfortunately is not a step in the right direction, and can yield disastrous results.</p>
          <p>It is needless to say, choosing SIPs requires detailed scrutiny of each aspect that may affect its returns, both in the long and short-term. Those successful in doing so usually end up investing in SIPs that are best for them, and not for the entity pushing for its purchase.</p>

          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Investments in SIP mutual funds are made in regular intervals, i.e. weekly, monthly or quarterly. Investors must predetermine an amount they are willing to invest in the SIP, and that amount will be auto-debited from their account on the specified date upon their standing instruction. After that, the investor will be assigned the corresponding number of mutual fund unitswhich will be determined by the current Net Asset Value of the plan (NAV).</p>

          <p><b>Rupee Cost Averaging</b></p>

          <p><b>Flexibility</b></p>
          <p>SIP mutual funds provide investors with much-needed flexibility. Investors can start, top up, pause or cancel their SIP investments as they please.</p>
          <p><b>Power of Compounding</b></p>
          <p>SIP investments are intended to be held for a long time, and since they work on the principle of compound interest, it allows investors to benefit from the same. Regular investments compound over time, resulting in higher returns for investors. One can also use an <b className="highlighted-text">SIP Calculator</b> to get an idea of the projected returns and Final Corpus.</p>

          <h2>Why should you avoid the Best SIP Plans ?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> Investors should avoid diverting money in table-topper SIPs, simply because at times the cut-off dates used for ranking the returns fetched are manipulated to project eye-popping gains.</p>
          <p>For instance, the previous one-year data of several SIPs with March-end 2021 as the cut-off reveals above-normal gains. The actual reason behind this commendable performance is, however, not superior fund selection, but the crash experienced by the Indian market in the corresponding period of the previous year i.e. March 2020.</p>
          <p>The recovery witnessed from thereon has been stellar, which several SIP entities are projecting as gains, which is misleading.</p>
          <p>Thus, only looking at previous returns even in case of an instrument like SIP, which offers Rupee Cost Averaging, won't be right.</p>
          <p>Why should you avoid the Best SIP Plans ? Because the research required to identify suitable schemes goes beyond comparing previous returns, period.</p>
