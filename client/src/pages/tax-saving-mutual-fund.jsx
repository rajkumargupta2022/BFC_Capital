          <h2>What Are Tax Saving Mutual Funds And How Do They Work?</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p>Tax Saving Mutual Funds, commonly known as ELSS (Equity Linked Saving Schemes), are like other mutual funds schemes and manifest gains over time. The only difference between tax-saving mutual funds schemes and other mutual funds schemes is that they offer the additional benefit of tax saving. These funds are eligible for tax rebates provided under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act.</p>
          <p>ITypically, investments made under tax-saving mutual funds are equity-linked, which helps investors in wealth creation and achieve higher returns. Since most of the tax-saving mutual funds are ELSS Schemes, they offer a tax rebate of up to Rs. 1,50,000, helping the investors save up to Rs 46,800 on taxes every year. Also, investments in tax-saving mutual funds are usually made in Multi-Cap catagory.</p>
          <p>How do they work?</p>
          <p>Tax-saving mutual funds combine the money of several investors and further invest it in the equity market. ELSS Funds have a mandatory three-year lock-in period, and the investor cannot liquidate the investment before the conclusion of the lock-in.</p>
          <p>Also, when the investor chooses to invest via an SIP, the lock-in period for each individual instalment is three years, starting from the day the contribution was made. For example, if the first instalment was made on August 1, 2020, and the second was made on September 1, 2020, then on August 1, 2023, the lock-in for only the first instalment will end, whereas the second one will end on September 1, 2023.</p>

Investors can start by gaining an idea of the amount of tax they can save when investing in tax-saving mutual funds using an ELSS Calculator. Also listed below are some pointers investors must consider before choosing tax-saving mutual funds or ELSS Funds.</p>
          <p><b>Investor's Risk Profile</b></p>

The best investments are those that are compatible with the investor's profile.</p>
          <p><b>Schemes/Fund History</b></p>

          <p><b>Previous Performance of Fund House</b></p>
          <p>When selecting a tax-saving mutual fund, it is important to check the previous performance of the fund house or AMC. Investors must compare the fund performance of various AMCs and choose the best possible alternative.</p>
          <p><b>Professional Recommendation</b></p>
          <p>Choosing and investing in ELSS Funds can be challenging at times, and hence it is advised to get professional assistance. Mutual Fund Distributors are equipped with tools that help them evaluate better schemes based on all the necessary parameters.</p>
          <p><b>How to invest in tax-saving mutual funds</b></p>

            <li>Select the amount you are planning to invest towards the fund and the investment mode, i.e. via an SIP or a lump sum.</li>

          <h2>Tax Saving Mutual Funds and PPF : A Comparison</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> PPF investments are widely considered a safer bet when it comes to investing for tax saving purposes, given their asynchronicity to equity markets. That said, there is a large section of investors that also invests in tax saving mutual funds. Let's see how they both fare on various parameters.</p>
          <p>The returns offered under PPF presently are around 7-8 % a year. As per the data of last 10 years tax saving Mutual Funds have offered returns in the range of 12 to 14%.</p>
          <p>Yes, PPF investments are tax exempted, accumulation and withdrawal included. Tax saving Mutual funds, on the other hand, attract 10 per cent LTCG tax. However, the smart investor knows that this levy is subject to the condition that the returns manifested after a holding period of one year are more than Rs. 1 lakh. Meaning, the amount invested in tax saving funds can be adjusted to keep the returns below the Rs. 1 lakh threshold and consequently avoid the 10 per cent levy.</p>
          <p>Also, PPF investments carry a lock-in of 15 years(one can withdraw partially after 5 years), which means the money invested is frozen through the investment tenure. Tax saving funds, on the other hand, have just a 3-year lock-in, making them better on liquidity front.</p>
          <p>Besides this, PPF schemes have an upper ceiling in terms of the tenure and quantum of investment allowed. The maximum tenure allowed under PPF schemes is 15 years with an acceptable extension of another 5 years. The maximum quantum of investment allowed stands at Rs. 1,50,000 a year. Tax saving funds, however, do not carry any such ceiling and grant investors the flexibility needed to save tax as per their monitory obligations.</p>

          <h2>Lock-in factor of Tax Saving Mutual Funds</h2>
          <div className="pageTitleBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <div className="text-description">
          <p> Tax saver Mutual Funds are accompanied by a mandatory lock-in period of 3 years, ELSS included. This lock-in period is an essential part of Tax Saving Instruments. All of them like PPF, 5 year Bank FD etc carry this.</p>
          <p>The lock-in period helps fund managers avoid the liquidity issues that accompany excessive selling, thereby encouraging stability in the scheme.</p>
          <p>This, however, does not mean that the investor should exit the investment and redeem his units as soon as the lock-in period ends. One can continue the acquisition, provided the fund’s performance and its market impact have been analysed by a Sebi-registered investment advisor.</p>
          <p>If need be, one can also re-invest the units redeemed, provided the prevalent market dynamics and the investor’s monitory profile demand so, which again shall have to be validated by a professional.</p>
          <p>Long story short, keeping the money invested for long durations is the advisable strategy when it comes to Mutual Funds, tax savers or not, provided the scheme’s performance is satisfactory and staying invested has been okayed by a professional.</p>
